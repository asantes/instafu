Instafu allows you to automate likes and follows based on hastags, lists of followers or profiles. It basically "likes" publications and "follows" profiles. The idea is to get noticed by potential clients,
It's a non-intrusive way to say "Hi!".

It works along with Selenium, so it's simulating interaction with the browser.

Contais two executables .py:

  1. loggin.py : You must run this code in order to get the cookie from Instagram. It takes your user&password from a file
  2. fu.pu : After succesfully loggin into Instagram by running the loggin.py, you can now run this .py which is the main file project

Instagram's quotas are quite a nightmare: they change unceasingly and are not the same for everyone. They track individual behavior, so your quotas after a month with more interactions inside
the Instagram app are going to be quite different from the previous month. I've taken these quotas into account very much, and the app it's thought to run for a couple days without getting warnings.
